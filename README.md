# Commute Together

This is the mobile application written in React Native using Expo. The application connects people who want to commute together. Users can add the new ride and be the driver for that ride, or search rides and apply to be one of the passengers in the car.

Start the development server by running the following command:

```
expo start

```

To open the app:
- On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
- On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
